# Minimum Time Actuator Constrained Trajectory Generation for a differentially flat aircraft.

## Based on the work by Mark Cutler: http://acl.mit.edu/papers/Cutler_Masters12.pdf

This package is capable of generating minimum time polynomial trajectories through N waypoints with structure constraints.
